# Spellchecker Engine
A command-line spellchecker engine built in C++ using a Trie data structure. It allows users to load words from a text corpus, check for word existence, print suggestions with matching prefixes, and manage words interactively via text commands. The engine supports insertions, deletions, and real-time spellchecking from standard input.
